# Gait CNN

This is an implementation for Paper Improved gait recognition based on specialized deep convolutional neural network, which use one-to-one convolution layer to reduce parameter number of the model.

now we have result for experiment in 6.1 and 6.2 even better than result in paper.

Not finished yet.
